## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React / React Native / Vue / Flutter (choose what you used)
- Backend: Node.js + Express / Django / Flask / Ruby on Rails (choose what you used)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (choose what you used)
- Real-time: Socket.IO / Firebase Realtime Database / Pusher
- Notifications: Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (Email), Firebase Cloud Messaging (push)
- Hosting: Vercel / Netlify (frontend), Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean (backend)

(Replace with exact technologies and versions used in your repository.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 14 (if using Node)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB running (if using a SQL/NoSQL DB)
- An account/API keys for Twilio, SendGrid, Firebase if you want notifications

### Install
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/blood-connex.git
2. Install dependencies (backend)
   cd backend
   npm install
3. Install dependencies (frontend)
   cd ../frontend
   npm install

### Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend (and frontend if needed) with the following variables (example):
- PORT=4000
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/blood_connex
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
- TWILIO_SID=your_twilio_sid
- TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
- SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
- FIREBASE_CONFIG=your_firebase_config_json

Adjust keys based on the services you integrate.

### Run
Start backend:
  cd backend
  npm run dev

Start frontend:
  cd frontend
  npm start

Open http://localhost:3000 (or configured port) in your browser.

## Usage
- Register as a donor, recipient, or blood bank.
- Complete your profile: blood group, location, availability, contact details.
- Recipients can create urgent requests specifying blood group, units needed, location, and deadline.
- Donors will receive notifications of nearby urgent requests; they can accept and coordinate with the recipient or blood bank.
- Admins can verify blood bank accounts, moderate listings, and view analytics.

## API Endpoints
Examples (adjust to the actual routes in your repo):
- POST /api/auth/register — Register user
- POST /api/auth/login — Login
- GET /api/donors — Search donors
- POST /api/requests — Create blood request
- PATCH /api/requests/:id/accept — Accept a request
- GET /api/admin/statistics — Admin analytics

Document endpoints in more detail (request/response examples and authentication requirements) in an API.md or in-line Swagger/OpenAPI file.

## Database
- Schema highlights:
  - users (id, name, email, role, blood_group, location, availability, verified)
  - requests (id, requester_id, blood_group, units, location, status, created_at)
  - notifications (id, user_id, type, data, read)
  - blood_banks (id, name, address, contact, verified)
- Migrations: Use your ORM's migration tooling (e.g., Sequelize, TypeORM, Alembic, Django Migrations).

## Testing
- Unit tests: npm run test
- Integration tests: describe how to run them
- Use jest / mocha / pytest / RSpec based on your stack

## Deploying
- Backend: Deploy to Heroku / AWS Elastic Beanstalk / DigitalOcean App Platform
- Frontend: Deploy to Vercel / Netlify
- Set environment variables in the hosting provider
- Use a managed database (Amazon RDS, Heroku Postgres, MongoDB Atlas)

CI/CD:
- Add GitHub Actions workflow for tests and deployment
- Run database migrations on deploy

## Contributing
